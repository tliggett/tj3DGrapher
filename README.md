# tj3DGrapher

Welcome to my 3D Graphing Calculator! This will serve as my innovation presentation for the trimester.

After struggling to visualize equations in Calc 3, I decided it would be important to find a graphing calculator that worked in R3, or 3 dimensions. After combing the internet for possible solutions I found two: one that only worked on Apple computers, and one that costs money. At a crossroads, I decided to create my own 3D graphing calculator: tj3DGrapher!

The grapher is simple to use, although at this time one must have a basic understanding of Java to use it. The user can control the program from the UserMod section, and in this they can write their own equation, as well as set the equation's name and initial detail.

Using WASD (all capital inputs), the user can control the detail of the function. The detail is extremely important; too little detail will result in an invisible function, while too much detail will crash your computer. 

The lower the detail vector is, the higher the detail will be in the function.

Using + and _ (Underscore), the using can zoom in and out of the function.

There are other inputs that can be entered in the input bar (all x and y values are floats):
1) help - opens the help menu
2) view
